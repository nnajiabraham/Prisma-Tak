advantages of graphql
implent simple node graphql with resolvers

what is prisma, advantages
performant query resolution (N+1 problem) if request user, need post then you need to make
request for user and then get post id's and go back to get post. solves with fetching and caching


out of box crud and realtime operation

end to end typesafety (can get with only graphql )

graphqlgen - code gen tool looks at graphql schema and scaffold reolvers needed entirely typesafe, go, typescript etc.

give example of normal resolvers and with using prisma

prisma cli
existing db introspect db and generate client api on that
create new db configured with docker
hosted db in prisma cloud
select client JS since node JS

generated files 3
prisma.yml main config points to datamodel which is written with graphql schema language(graphql SDL) - 
special directives for constraints on datamodel

prisma deploy command
and generate client
can go in  node script, use prisma generated client to perform operations against database

add prisma-client-lib and graphql dependancies to proj

bring prisma client and earlier graphql resolver functions together for graphql frontend api
